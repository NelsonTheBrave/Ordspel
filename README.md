# YET ANOTHER WORDLE CLONE

Please run `npm install` and `npm start` commands from ./backend

Note that the files in ./frontend/dist are not used. They have been copied to ./backend/assets. This might cause some confusion and is a bit of a quick fix right now since I didn't manage to tell Vite Build to directly build into that backend folder.

Another possible point of confusion is the folder ./oldAlgorithms. It is not used either in this project and will be moved somewhere else at some point in the future.

Good luck, have fun!
